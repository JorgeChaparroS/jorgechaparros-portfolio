# jorgechaparros-portfolio
This application is built in Angular 17 (latest version of the framework so far), and it gathers some of relevant projects that I have worked in. They are not related to my current or previus jobs, just, projects that I have developed or contributed in my free time. Because once you start to like coding, it is hard to stop doing it. It becomes a passion. 

Here you are going to find frontend, backend and fullstack projects. (Actually, only frontend projects are available LOL, but I promise to continue expanding my content, just give me some time)

I hope you like it!
